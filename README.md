# 🗺️ U.S. States Guessing Game 

Welcome to the **U.S. States Guessing Game**! This educational Python project invites players to test their knowledge of U.S. states while enjoying a fun and interactive experience using Turtle graphics.

## 📁 Project Structure

This project includes three main files:

1. **`main.py`** - The heart of the game, where all the logic unfolds.
2. **`50_states.csv`** - A CSV file containing the names and coordinates of each U.S. state, guiding the turtle to the correct location on the map.
3. **`blank_states_img.gif`** - An image file that serves as the map of the United States where the states will be displayed.

### File Descriptions

- **`main.py`**: This script creates a window displaying a map of the United States. Players can guess the names of the states, and upon a correct guess, the corresponding state will appear at its designated location on the map.

- **`50_states.csv`**: This file stores state names alongside their respective X and Y coordinates, allowing the turtle to navigate to the correct position for each guessed state.

- **`blank_states_img.gif`**: This image provides the visual backdrop for the game, showing a blank map of the U.S. where players can visualize their guesses.

## 📂 File Organization

To ensure smooth operation of the game, please keep all three files (`main.py`, `50_states.csv`, and `blank_states_img.gif`) in the same folder. This organization is crucial for the game to access the necessary resources correctly.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Run the Game**: Execute `main.py` to start the game.
2. **Guess States**: Type in the name of a state when prompted. The game will keep track of your correct guesses.
3. **Visual Feedback**: Correct guesses will be displayed on the map at their respective coordinates!
4. **Exit the Game**: Type "Exit" to end the game, and any missed states will be saved in `States_Missed.csv` for your review.

## ⚙️ Requirements

To get started, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python (version 3.x)
- The `turtle` library (usually included with Python)
- The `pandas` library (install with `pip install pandas`)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/us-states-game.git
   cd us-states-game
   ```

2. **Ensure Necessary Files**: Make sure you have:
   - `50_states.csv`
   - `blank_states_img.gif`

3. **Run the Game**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 🌟 Features

- **Interactive Learning**: An engaging way to learn U.S. geography.
- **Visual Map Representation**: Utilize Turtle graphics for a fun and interactive interface.
- **Performance Tracking**: Automatically saves missed states for later practice.

## 📈 Future Enhancements

- Implement hints or clues for each state.
- Create a scoring system based on time or accuracy.
- Add multiplayer options for competitive play!

## 🤔 Fun Fact

Did you know? **The state of Alaska is larger than the next three largest states (Texas, California, and Montana) combined!** It’s a huge state with diverse landscapes and wildlife.
